It will cover the history of the corporation, its changing role vis a vis the state and society, and different approaches to controlling the extent and distribution of its social and environmental impacts. Coursework will include exploring specific cases emblematic of resource governance issues around transnational land investments, global food systems, mines, and tree plantations. Through these cases, we will compare approaches to governing the corporation, from self-governance by firms and industry organizations, to consumer-driven change, to formal regulatory mechanisms. In all this, we will learn to take a political ecology approach to our analysis, meaning we will place governance and policy questions in their historical, political economy, discursive, and socio-material contexts.</p>\n<p>In the past, I have taught Policy in Context (<a href=\"https://sppga.ubc.ca/master-public-policy-global-affairs/curriculum/\">PPGA 508</a>) and advised a Global Policy Project (<a href=\"https://sppga.ubc.ca/master-public-policy-global-affairs/experiential-learning/global-policy-project/\">PPGA 590</a>) in the UBC School of Public Policy and Global Affairs where I am jointly appointed.

Before graduate school, I worked on multiple spatial databases documenting foreign land investments in Laos (primarily the <a href=\"https://www.cde.unibe.ch/research/projects/the_lao_decide_info_project/index_eng.html#:~:text=Lao%20Decide%20Info-,The%20Lao%20DECIDE%20info%20Project%20seeks%20to%20stimulate%20data%20and,decision%2Dmaking%20in%20Lao%20PDR.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lao DECIDE info Project</a>). This work was foundational to my dissertation research, which examined the political economy of Chinese rubber investments - one of the most extensive forms of Chinese agricultural investment in the Mekong Region.</p>\n<p class=\"align-left smallspace\">I looked at the history of rubber production in China, particularly at its status as a ‘strategic resource’ and the importance of the State Farms system in structuring the domestic rubber sector. I then examined the Chinese and Lao state policies that drove a boom in rubber across northern Laos in the 2000s, and the ways Chinese companies have negotiated and competed for access to land, labor, and market share.</p>\n<p class=\"align-left smallspace\">My findings contribute to broader understandings of how land grabs unfold on the ground, the influence of the Chinese state over its companies operating abroad, and power dynamics between Chinese investors and actors in host countries - from state officials, to plantation workers, to local land users.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"column\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"width: 100%;\" src=\"https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/IMG_5241-2.jpg\" alt=\"Field\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_5241-2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_5241-2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_5241-2-md.jpg 768w ,https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_5241-2-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_5241-2-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_5241-2-2xl.jpg 1600w\"></div>\n<div class=\"column\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"width: 100%;\" src=\"https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/IMG_0767.JPG\" alt=\"Flags in front building\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_0767-xs.JPG 300w ,https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_0767-sm.JPG 480w ,https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_0767-md.JPG 768w ,https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_0767-lg.JPG 1024w ,https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_0767-xl.JPG 1360w ,https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_0767-2xl.JPG 1600w\"></div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"align-left\"><strong>Crop Booms and Plantation Politics</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-left smallspace\">The tradeoffs between intensive monoculture plantation production and alternative systems of agriculture are widely debated. In collaboration with a group of land systems scientists, critical agrarian scholars, agricultural economists, and political ecologists working across Southeast Asia, I am currently exploring the rise of crop booms in border regions and their implications for trajectories of agrarian change, rural development, and the environment. This collaboration was launched during the <a href=\"https://euroseas2019.org/program/panels/crop-booms-in-borderlands-perspectives-from-southeast-asia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EuroSEAS panel</a> I co-hosted in 2019, and resulted in a collaboratively written <a href=\"https://www.newmandala.org/smallholder-crop-booms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blog post</a> on the topic and is now being developed into multiple comparative case study analyses. </p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"column\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"width: 100%;\" src=\"https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/IMG_1277-2.JPG\" alt=\"\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_1277-2-xs.JPG 300w ,https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_1277-2-sm.JPG 480w ,https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_1277-2-md.JPG 768w ,https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_1277-2-lg.JPG 1024w ,https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_1277-2-xl.JPG 1360w ,https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_1277-2-2xl.JPG 1600w\"></div>\n<div class=\"column\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"width: 100%;\" src=\"https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/IMG_3339.jpg\" alt=\"\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_3339-xs.jpg 300w ,https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_3339-sm.jpg 480w ,https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_3339-md.jpg 768w ,https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_3339-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_3339-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_3339-2xl.jpg 1600w\"></div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Sustainable Supply Chains, Standards &amp; Voluntary Guidelines</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-left smallspace\">Monoculture rubber plantations have expanded dramatically across Southeast Asia, particularly in the last two decades, driving mass clear-cutting of some of the world’s most biodiverse, carbon-rich forests. China is the top consumer of natural rubber globally, and the spread of rubber is a major contributor to deforestation and landscape simplification in the region, but Chinese firms are resistant to market-based environmental incentives and new to collaborating with civil society groups. As a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Atkinson Center for Sustainability, I began analyzing emerging sustainability and conservation initiatives as they engage a range of actors along Chinese dominated supply chains. </p>\n<p class=\"align-left smallspace\">I am continuing this work at the University of British Columbia. I work directly with policymakers in China and Laos, and in partnership with environmental organizations (Oxfam, Forest Trends, the World Agroforestry Centre, and the Mekong Region Land Governance Project) in carrying out this research. This research contributes to the sustainable governance of supply chains in which Chinese firms play a central role, and to debates over China’s role in limiting tropical deforestation and improving rural livelihoods across Southeast Asia.</p>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/49A27895-F3B3-47D3-BA9D-9AA2922DC8AF_1_105_c.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"671\" height=\"503\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/responsive/49A27895-F3B3-47D3-BA9D-9AA2922DC8AF_1_105_c-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/responsive/49A27895-F3B3-47D3-BA9D-9AA2922DC8AF_1_105_c-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/responsive/49A27895-F3B3-47D3-BA9D-9AA2922DC8AF_1_105_c-md.jpeg 768w ,https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/responsive/49A27895-F3B3-47D3-BA9D-9AA2922DC8AF_1_105_c-lg.jpeg 1024w ,https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/responsive/49A27895-F3B3-47D3-BA9D-9AA2922DC8AF_1_105_c-xl.jpeg 1360w ,https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/responsive/49A27895-F3B3-47D3-BA9D-9AA2922DC8AF_1_105_c-2xl.jpeg 1600w\"></figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"column\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"width: 670px;\" src=\"https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/IMG_4665.jpg\" alt=\"Forest of rubber trees\" height=\"503\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_4665-xs.jpg 300w ,https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_4665-sm.jpg 480w ,https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_4665-md.jpg 768w ,https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_4665-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_4665-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://julietlu.com/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_4665-2xl.jpg 1600w\"></div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Perennial Plantings for Net Zero Agriculture in Canada</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Over the next 4 years I will be co-leading the policy and qualitative social science components of the <a href=\"https://percs.landfood.ubc.ca/\"><span class=\"s1\">PERCS project</span></a>. </p>\n<p class=\"align-left\"><strong>Illicit Crop Geographies</strong></p>\n<p class=\"align-left smallspace\">A pivotal driver in the rubber boom in northern Laos was the Chinese state’s promotion of the crop as a sustainable and economically viable alternative to opium cultivation.

This approach is motivated by the five years I spent working in the environmental sector in China (World Agroforestry Centre, 2009-11) and Laos (Centre for Development and Environment, 2012-13) prior to my graduate studies. It is also a reaction to the polarizing nature of studies of China in today's political environment - an environment I believe distracts and distorts and thus requires response from critical scholars. To ensure the practical relevance and on-the-ground impact of my research, I try to work with policymakers and private sector actors in China and Laos, and I conduct research in partnership with environmental organizations who can better use this research to inform immediate actions.</p>\n<p class=\"align-left smallspace\">I publish not only in academic fora but also in topical and regional blogs and other media outlets, and co-host the “Belt and Road Podcast,” which features research, news, and in-depth analysis of China’s global investments. Communicating across this diversity of forums helps me to sharpen and clarify my own arguments and breathes meaning into the questions that drive my research.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>I am a political ecologist focused on land politics and the drivers and impacts of agricultural expansion across the world. In particular, I am interested in what policies, sociocultural practices, and market forces determine the balance between large-scale, intensive commercial plantations and small-scale, complex production systems. One way I explore this is through China’s growing investments in land and other resources in the Mekong Region - a topic which has forced me to think about the politics of China’s broader economic and environmental engagements. Another way is through supply chain initiatives targeting agriculture-driven deforestation in Southeast Asia, and another is through efforts to store carbon thorugh perennial planting across Canada’s agricultural landscapes. </p><p>In my research, writing, and teaching, I aim to connect my findings to interdisciplinary, impact-oriented debates around environmental conflicts, agricultural production, and China’s global expansion. I engage with various data sources and methods for conducting in-depth, comparative local cases that reflect global trends. I prioritize the collection of on-the-ground empirical data through long-term fieldwork in China, Laos, and across the Mekong Region, and will continue this grounded approach to my work in British Columbia, Canada. I engage not only with other academics but also with policymakers and the general public in shaping more sustainable, just systems of environmental governance and development. I consider these engagements important to enhancing the quality and relevance of my work and inspiring the broader direction of my scholarly inquiries.</p><p>On a more personal note, I was born and raised in Nashua, New Hampshire, on the unceded territory of the Pennacook, Abenaki and Wabanaki Peoples. I am a first generation Chinese American on my dad’s side and a French Irish settler on my mom’s. I’m a mom of two boys, I love to play Ultimate Frisbee (for fun, not for glory), and hip hop is my favorite art form. I have been deeply affected by mental health struggles in my family which I am happy to discuss if it can help others in similar situations. </p>",
