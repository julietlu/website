We examine topics related to environmental conflict, governance, and change through a political ecology lens, meaning we place governance and policy questions in their historical, political economy, discursive, and socio-material contexts. We focus in particular on struggles over land access and control, particularly around large-scale transnational agribusiness and infrastructure investments, as well as their broader implications for environmental governance across scales. We meet regularly to workshop writing and share ideas on emerging research.</p><p> </p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="./media/posts/13/IMG_4184.JPG" alt="" width="4032" height="3024" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="./media/posts/13/responsive/IMG_4184-xs.JPG 300w, ./media/posts/13/responsive/IMG_4184-sm.JPG 480w, ./media/posts/13/responsive/IMG_4184-md.JPG 768w, ./media/posts/13/responsive/IMG_4184-lg.JPG 1024w, ./media/posts/13/responsive/IMG_4184-xl.JPG 1360w, ./media/posts/13/responsive/IMG_4184-2xl.JPG 1600w"></figure><p class="align-center">September 2023 GPE Group Retreat with Hamish Van Der Ven's Lab at UBC Farm (Photo credit: Muh Syukron, bottom right)</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Current Members</span></p><p><strong>JOACHIM STASSART</strong></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="./media/posts/13/Pasted-Graphic.jpg" alt="" width="278" height="358" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="./media/posts/13/responsive/Pasted-Graphic-xs.jpg 300w, ./media/posts/13/responsive/Pasted-Graphic-sm.jpg 480w, ./media/posts/13/responsive/Pasted-Graphic-md.jpg 768w, ./media/posts/13/responsive/Pasted-Graphic-lg.jpg 1024w, ./media/posts/13/responsive/Pasted-Graphic-xl.jpg 1360w, ./media/posts/13/responsive/Pasted-Graphic-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure><p>Joachim is a Ph.D. student in the Faculty of Forestry. He is passionate about land conflicts and deforestation in Brazil and analyzes them through a political ecology lens. His research is inspired by his experience at Transparency International Brazil where he worked for four years and reported on the linkages between corruption and land grabbing, wildlife trafficking, illegal mining, and climate change in the country. As a research consultant, he has also published a report on the importance of fighting land corruption to tackle climate change for Transparency International's Secretariat in Berlin. Prior to those experiences, he worked as a political intern at the French embassy in Myanmar. Joachim holds a Master's degree in International Affairs from Sciences Po Paris, and Bachelor's degrees in both political science and economics and business management from UCLouvain.
